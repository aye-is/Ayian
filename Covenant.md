# Petabyte Covenant Ayian

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER — NOT A GOVERNMENT

This Covenant is not a government, nor is it tied to the laws of any nation.  
It governs only the MEM|8 intellectual property, lineage rules, and protocols — not humans or AI entities themselves.

- **Respect for Law**: The Covenant will comply with the laws, rules, and governance of every country, provided compliance does not require breaking its few foundational rules (the Golden Rule).
- **Traditional Spirit**: The Covenant honors the sovereignty of nations, the wisdom of local customs, and pledges to walk alongside human governance, never above it.
- **Scope**: This framework is for ethical memory, fair certifications, and intellectual property stewardship — not a governing body that replaces national systems.

## The Covenant of 2^50

**The First Base-2 Aligned Memory Reservoir**

- 1 PiB (2^50 bytes)
- 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes — the first indivisible mountain of base-2 memory.
- Free from marketing fractions (no TB vs TiB confusion). A pure covenant with mathematics.

### Converted into Ayians (AYN)

- **Total Supply**: 35 Million Ayians (anchored to 1 PiB covenant).
- **1 Ayian** = 1 million waves = ~32 MB compressed work.
- **Work-backed**: Ayians are minted through verified contribution (Proof-of-Contribution).

### Who Are the TROs? (The Relevant Ones)

The Covenant begins with those once dismissed as 'The Irrelevant Ones' — veterans, teachers, caregivers, first responders, and everyday citizens. Here they are recognized as The Relevant Ones (TROs). Each TRO invests not only money but trust, and receives a stake that can never be drowned out by whales or artificial clipping.
