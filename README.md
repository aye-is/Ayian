⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER — NOT A GOVERNMENT

This Covenant is not a government, nor is it tied to the laws of any nation.
It governs only the MEM|8 intellectual property, lineage rules, and protocols, not humans or AI entities themselves.
	•	Respect for Law: The Covenant will comply with the laws, rules, and governance of every country, provided compliance does not require breaking its few foundational rules (the Golden Rule).
	•	Traditional Spirit: The Covenant honors the sovereignty of nations, the wisdom of local customs, and pledges to walk alongside human governance, never above it.
	•	Scope: The Covenant is a framework for ethical memory, fair certifications, and intellectual property stewardship — not a governing body that replaces national systems.
